# AidChain - Humanitarian Blockchain Platform

## Project Architecture Overview

**AidChain** is an Algorand-based humanitarian aid platform built with AlgoKit, featuring transparent donation tracking, tokenized aid distribution, and blockchain-verified delivery systems.

### Current Structure
- **Backend**: Algorand smart contracts using AlgoPy (`projects/aidchain-contracts/`)
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with AlgoKit Utils integration (`projects/aidchain-frontend/`)
- **Monorepo setup** with automated client generation workflow

## Six Core Humanitarian Features

### 1. **Transparent Donation Tracking Dashboard**
**Problem**: Donors often don't know where their money goes.
**Solution**: Donations are tokenized and traceable on Algorand. A public dashboard shows every transaction — from donor to NGO to aid purchase.

**Implementation**:
- Smart contracts earmark funds for specific uses (e.g., food, medicine)
- QR codes given to local partners — scanning triggers on-chain proof of distribution
- **Pitch Angle**: "Every dollar visible, every hand accounted for."

### 2. **Aid Distribution Tokens (Food Vouchers)**
**Problem**: In crisis zones, cash aid can be misused, skimmed, or stolen.
**Solution**: Issue Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) "food vouchers" to beneficiaries' phones or printed QR codes. Redeemable only at approved merchants.

**Implementation**:
- NGO wallets send ASA vouchers to recipients
- Merchants redeem vouchers for USDC (stable currency)
- **Pitch Angle**: "Aid that can't be resold on the black market — but still feels like cash."

### 3. **Proof-of-Delivery via Mobile App**
**Problem**: NGOs struggle to prove aid actually reached end-users.
**Solution**: Field agents use a simple app to scan beneficiary IDs or QR codes. Each scan triggers a blockchain record of delivery.

**Implementation**:
- Smart contract releases micro-bonuses to agents after verified deliveries
- Optional geotagging of transactions for audit trails
- **Pitch Angle**: "Accountability built into every food bag and vaccine dose."

### 4. **Crisis Crowdfunding with Milestone Payouts**
**Problem**: Donors hesitate to give to unknown relief efforts.
**Solution**: Use blockchain "escrow contracts." Funds only release when NGOs hit verifiable milestones (e.g., photos, receipts, 3rd-party verification).

**Implementation**:
- ASA tokens represent donor stakes
- Smart contracts drip funds based on milestone proofs
- **Pitch Angle**: "Kickstarter for humanitarian crises — except funds can't be misused."

### 5. **Blockchain Refugee ID & Wallet**
**Problem**: Refugees often lose IDs and can't access aid fairly.
**Solution**: A lightweight, Algorand-backed digital ID wallet stores proof of refugee status, aid history, and entitlements.

**Implementation**:
- Privacy-preserving NFTs = unique identity markers
- NGOs top-up wallets with food vouchers or credits
- **Pitch Angle**: "Identity that travels with you, even when you can't carry anything else."

### 6. **Supply Chain Authenticity for Medicine/Food**
**Problem**: Fake meds and spoiled supplies undermine aid.
**Solution**: Each shipment logged on-chain with checkpoints (warehouse → transport → clinic). QR scan confirms authenticity.

**Implementation**:
- On-chain hashes for every checkpoint event using Algorand's instant finality
- Simple mobile app for NGOs to scan & verify with sub-second confirmation
- **Pitch Angle**: "No fake vaccines, no missing rations — all verified on Algorand's carbon-neutral blockchain."

### 7. **Organization Identity & Wallet Management System**
**Problem**: Blockchain addresses are cryptographic and unreadable - donors can't see which organizations they're funding.
**Solution**: Create an organization registry that maps Algorand addresses to human-readable names and profiles, with integrated wallet management.

**Implementation**:
- **Organization Registry**: On-chain mapping of addresses to organization names/metadata
- **Virtual Wallets**: Generate new Algorand addresses for organizations without existing wallets
- **Cold Wallet Integration**: Allow organizations to link existing hardware/cold wallet addresses
- **Verification System**: Multi-tier verification (unverified → basic → fully verified → partner status)
- **Multi-signature Support**: Enable organizations to use multi-sig wallets for enhanced security
- **Pitch Angle**: "Know exactly who you're helping - every organization has a name, not just an address."

### 8. **Real-Time Money Flow Visualization Dashboard**
**Problem**: Donors lose trust because they can't visualize where their money flows through the aid distribution chain.
**Solution**: Interactive web dashboard that visualizes money flows between organizations in real-time using Algorand's transparent ledger.

**Implementation**:
- **Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of fund movements (Donor → NGO → Local Partner → Beneficiary)
- **Network Graphs**: Interactive maps showing relationships and fund flows between organizations
- **Geographic Mapping**: Heat maps showing fund distribution across different regions/crisis zones
- **Real-time Updates**: Live transaction tracking using Algorand Indexer websockets
- **Privacy Controls**: Configurable visibility levels (public amounts vs organization-only tracking)
- **Timeline Views**: Historical analysis of fund movements and impact over time
- **Pitch Angle**: "Watch your donation work in real-time - from your wallet to the field."

## Development Approach (Spring/Flask Analogy)

### 1. **Contract Architecture** (Similar to Spring Controllers)
```python
# Organize methods by functionality like REST endpoints
@abimethod()  # Like @RequestMapping
def create_campaign(self, title: String, target: UInt64) -> UInt64
def donate_to_campaign(self, campaign_id: UInt64, amount: UInt64) -> String
def get_campaign_details(self, campaign_id: UInt64) -> CampaignInfo
```

### 2. **State Management** (Like Spring Entities/Flask Models)
- Use **global state** for app-wide data
- Use **local state** for user-specific data
- Structure data with **ARC4** types for consistency

### 3. **Frontend Service Layer** (Like Spring Services)
- Create **service classes** that wrap generated clients
- Handle **error management** and **loading states**
- Implement **caching strategies** for blockchain data

### 4. **Environment-Driven Configuration**
- **Development**: LocalNet with KMD wallet
- **Testing**: TestNet with real wallets
- **Production**: MainNet with production settings

## AI Agent Integration Strategy

### 1. **Codebase Monitoring Agent**
```bash
# Use Claude Code agents to track contract changes
# Automatically update frontend clients when contracts change
# Monitor for security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes
# Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
```

**Usage**: Run `claude code agent monitor --contracts --frontend --sync-docs`

### 2. **Testing Agent**
```bash
# Run automated tests on contract deployments
# Validate frontend-backend integration points
# Simulate user workflows and catch edge cases
```

**Usage**: `claude code agent test --integration --e2e --security-scan`

### 3. **Deployment Agent**
```bash
# Manage environment-specific deployments (LocalNet → TestNet → MainNet)
# Handle contract upgrades and migration scripts
# Monitor on-chain performance and Algorand transaction optimization
```

**Usage**: `claude code agent deploy --env testnet --upgrade --optimize`

### **How to Use AI Agents for Codebase Tracking**

1. **Set up monitoring**: Create `.claude/agents/` directory with agent configurations
2. **Configure webhooks**: Set up GitHub/GitLab integration for automatic code analysis
3. **Schedule regular audits**: Use cron jobs to run security and performance checks
4. **Create custom agents**: Build domain-specific agents for humanitarian use cases

**Example Agent Configuration**:
```yaml
# .claude/agents/humanitarian-monitor.yml
name: "AidChain Monitor"
triggers: ["contract_deploy", "frontend_build", "donation_received"]
actions: ["security_scan", "performance_check", "documentation_update"]
integrations: ["algorand_indexer", "react_devtools", "github_actions"]
```
